                    <p><b>History</b>

                        <p>The St. George Utah Temple is a temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
                            Saints in St.
                            George, Utah. Saint George Utah Temple was announced on November 9, 1871 and dedicated
                            in April 6,
                            1877 by President Brigham Young, it was the church's third temple completed, but the
                            first in Utah.
                            George Temple was built to satisfy the church's immediate need for an appropriate place
                            for temple
                            ceremonies and ordinances. <b>Read more …</b></p>
                        <p>President Young chose a 6-acre plot as the temple site. Builders soon discovered that
                            the chosen
                            site was swampy with numerous underground streams. Young was consulted on moving the
                            site, but he
                            remained firm in the idea that this was the site for the temple. To deal with the
                            swampy site,
                            workers created drains to eliminate as much water as possible. Then they brought lava
                            rock to the
                            site and crushed it into a gravel to create a dry foundation for the temple. </p>
                        <p>After stabilizing the foundation, work began on the structure. The walls of the temple
                            were built of
                            the red sandstone common to the area and then plastered for a white finish. Local
                            church members
                            worked for over five and a half years to complete the temple. </p>
                        <p>Some members donated financial resources to help build the temple, while others gave
                            food, clothing
                            and other goods to aid those who were working full-time on the building. Women
                            decorated the
                            hallways with handmade rag carpets and produced fringe for the altars and pulpits from
                            Utah-produced silk.</p>
                        <p>In honor of the temple, the April 1877 General Conference was held there. After
                            remodeling of the
                            interior, the temple was rededicated on November 11, 1975.
